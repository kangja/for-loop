// for loops.
// we can run the same code multiple times using a loop. The most common loop in Javascript is called for loop because it runs for a specific number of times. 

// Structure of a for loop
// for ([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression]) {}
// the loop continues to run until condition is false. final-expression is evaluated at the end of each loop iteration. It is usually used to increment/decrement a loop counter.
